# COMP1350 Database Assignment 

### **COMP1350: Introduction to Database Design and Management**  

A conceptual and implementation-level database design project for COMP1350 at Macquarie University. This project showcases the application of data analysis, data modelling, and database development skills to design a conceptual ERD and implement it as a functional SQL database schema.

## ðŸ“‹ **Project Overview**  

### **1. Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)**  
- Designed using Crowâ€™s Foot notation based on provided business rules.  
- Includes entities, attributes, identifiers, named relationships, cardinality, constraints, and associative entities.  

### **2. Logical Transformation**  
- Step-by-step transformation of the ERD into a relational schema.   
- Includes a final schema with clearly identified Primary Keys (PK) and Foreign Keys (FK).  

### **3. SQL Implementation**  
- Creating tables based on logical schema.  
- Inserting sample data to populate the database.  
- Writing SQL queries to perform interactive operations and demonstrate database functionality.
